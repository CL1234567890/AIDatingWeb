# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

AI-powered dating app built for a 12-hour hackathon. The app aims to enhance the dating experience by combining traditional dating app features with intelligent AI assistance for better matches, conversations, and date planning.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Match Quality**: Uses AI to improve match recommendations beyond simple profile matching
2. **Conversation Anxiety**: Provides icebreaker generation and message interpretation to help users communicate better
3. **Date Planning Complexity**: Eliminates the stress of planning dates by automatically generating personalized locations and routes based on user's current vibe and preferences
4. **Generic Date Suggestions**: Instead of showing random places, intelligently selects destinations matching emotional tone and energy level

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Onboarding**: User registers/logs in with email+password (OAuth optional)
2. **Profile Creation**: User sets up profile with name, age, gender, interests, location
3. **Matching**: System finds and presents potential matches
4. **Conversation**: Users can chat with matches, with optional AI assistance (icebreakers, message interpretation)
5. **Date Planning**: System uses Google Maps API to generate personalized date locations and smart route planning based on user's vibe/preferences

### Key User Experience Goals
